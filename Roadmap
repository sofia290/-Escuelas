+Escuelas:
+Escuelas is an app that has the mission to improve the academic life of the student, showing him his academic performance, making a monitoring of the classes and giving him tools like a notebook and a calendar to make everything tidier.  

STRUCTURE:
1:See the prototypeÂ´s link we made to inspire how you would like that one saw the app.
2:We would like to see your proposals. what ideas you have or comments if you did some arrangement.
3:Reorder the ideas and have a model of the app. First, the virtual classes and the material of the classes, we have to create buttons.
4:For the design, we have to see the functions of the app, for it, we are going to take the principal articles:
#About virtual classes the idea is that the teacher could raise the material of the class, Ex. 3/31 and to could raise everything that was done in this class.
The app also would have a so-called button "qualifications" in which his nonattendances will be loaded in an insole  on the moment to do click, all the qualifications of the United pupil.
This tool also will possess them test, tasks, etc. The idea is that the teachers and pupils could load this information. 
Finally, it would be good that the application had one I spread of annotations in order that the pupils could complement the folder ,not only writing but also that could think photos

DESIGN:
Remind that for the present time, the app is for teenagers. We would like that one sees showy but also that it shows seriousness.
1:We would like to see your proposals. what ideas you have or comments if you did some arrangement.
2:Reorder the ideas and have a design of the app.

SIGHT TOWARDS THE FUTURE
1:We want to see if the app can come to a major scale. Ej: Functions for executives, for universities, infant school, etc.
