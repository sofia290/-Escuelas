In Argentina, the schools have the challenge to improve the relationship between the traditional education and the new technologies of information . the 80% of students use the red to make homework. in this years more teens leave their studies to take care of their children. the 15% of borns are of teen mothers between 15 and 17 years.
Talking about rural schools,  half of the students and teachers go at school walking. 2000 teachers go in bike, horse  and three of ten schools are isolated. there are 15.600 rural schools where just 10% of students of Argentina assist.

we created a prototype of the app with the platform of development “app inventor “ who had a calendar in which they could be seen the important dates and which could see what is done in the classes since a serious problem they are the nonattendances. Another stage that we want that it has is the individual qualifications and the nonattendances of the pupil, as a profile in which they have his  information. We wanted to propose virtual classes for the case of the young women who are pregnant and it becomes them very difficult to go to the college, For which they end up by retiring, we think that this would serve them very much. Another thing that we wanted to propose is an annotator to complement to the folder of paper. Finally, we would like to have a chat with a pedagogic assistant since we consider for a teenager in our case, It is easier to communicate for a chat that face-to-face.
Everything that we propose is in order that the pupils use the cellular one as a resource of learning and not as a distraction.

we seek to collaborate with very much enthusiasm and patient, we look for developers, designers, experts in education between others. If you don't belong to these groups of collaborators, there is no problem because your comment might help us very much.
